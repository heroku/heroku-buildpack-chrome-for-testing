# Heroku Buildpack, Chrome for Testing

This buildpack installs **Google Chrome browser** `chrome` & [`chromedriver`](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/), the Selenium driver for Chrome, in a Heroku app.

## Background

In summer 2023, the Chrome development team [addressed a long-standing problem with keeping Chrome & Chromedriver versions updated and aligned](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/chrome-for-testing/) with each other for automated testing environments. This buildpack follows this strategy to keep `chrome` & `chromedriver` versions  in-sync.

## Installation

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If migrating from a previous Chrome-chromedriver installation, then remove any pre-existing Chrome or Chromedriver buildpacks from the app. See the [migration guide](#migrating-from-separate-buildpacks).

```bash
heroku buildpacks:add -i 1 heroku-community/chrome-for-testing
```

Deploy the app to install Chrome for Testing. ðŸš€ 

## Launching `chrome`

To execute in a Heroku dyno, `chrome` typically requires the flags:

* `--headless`
* `--no-sandbox`

## Selecting the Chrome Release Channel

By default, this buildpack will download the latest `Stable` release, which is provided
by [Google](https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing/).

You can control the channel of the release by setting the `GOOGLE_CHROME_CHANNEL`
config variable to `Stable`, `Beta`, `Dev`, or `Canary`, and then deploy/build the app.

## Using an Older Chrome Release

If the most recent stable Chrome or Chromedriver release has problems, perhaps due to an 
app dependency like Selenium not being compatible yet, an older major release can be installed.

You can control how many major versions (milestones) back to install, with 
`GOOGLE_CHROME_MILESTONE_OFFSET` config variable.

*This version offset strategy does not lock the app to a specific Chrome version. It will still update automatically, but lag behind by the specified offset.*

Set `GOOGLE_CHROME_MILESTONE_OFFSET` to a negative index, such as:
* `-4` for the previous major stable release
* `-3` for the current major stable release
* `-2` for the beta release
* `-1` for the dev release.

During build, this offset indexes the milestone-sorted data returned from the Chrome for Testing API [`latest-versions-per-milestone.json`](https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing/latest-versions-per-milestone.json),
in order to resolve a specific version to install.

## Migrating from Separate Buildpacks

### Remove Existing Installations

When an app already uses the separate Chrome & Chromedriver buildpacks, remove them from the app, before adding this one:

```
heroku buildpacks:remove heroku/google-chrome
heroku buildpacks:remove heroku/chromedriver

heroku buildpacks:add -i 1 heroku-community/chrome-for-testing
```

### Path to Installed Executables

After being installed by this buildpack, `chrome` & `chromedriver` are set in the `PATH` of dynos.

If the absolute paths are required, you can discover their location in an app:

```bash
>>> heroku run bash
$ which chrome
/app/.chrome-for-testing/chrome-linux64/chrome
$ which chromedriver
/app/.chrome-for-testing/chromedriver-linux64/chromedriver
```

These locations may change in future versions of this buildpack, so please allow the operating system to resolve their locations from `PATH`, if possible.

### Changes to Command Flags

The prior `heroku/google-chrome` buildpack wrapped the `chrome` command with default flags using a shim script. This is no longer implemented for `chrome` in this buildpack, to support evolving changes to the Chrome for Testing flags.

Depending on how an app is already setup for testing with Chrome, it may not require any changes.

**If the app fails to start Chrome**, please ensure that the following argument flags are set wherever `chrome` is invoked:

* `--headless`
* `--no-sandbox`

Some use-cases may require these flags too:

* `--disable-gpu`
* `--remote-debugging-port=9222`
