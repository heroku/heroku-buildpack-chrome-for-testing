# Heroku Buildpack, Chrome for Testing

This buildpack installs **Google Chrome browser** `chrome` & [`chromedriver`](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/), the Selenium driver for Chrome, in a Heroku app.

## Background

In summer 2023, the Chrome development team [addressed a long-standing problem with keeping Chrome & Chromedriver versions updated and aligned](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/chrome-for-testing/) with each other for automated testing environments. This buildpack follows this strategy to keep `chrome` & `chromedriver` versions  in-sync.

## Selecting the Chrome Release Channel

By default, this buildpack will download the latest `Stable` release, which is provided
by [Google](https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing/).

You can control the channel of the release by setting the `GOOGLE_CHROME_CHANNEL`
config variable to `Stable`, `Beta`, `Dev`, or `Canary`, and then deploy/build the app.

## Releasing a new version

Make sure you publish this buildpack in the buildpack registry

`heroku buildpacks:publish heroku-community/chrome-for-testing main`
